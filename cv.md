1. My main goal today is self-development and the search for my purpose. I am currently working in social media marketing but want to develop more in programming. Perhaps it will be SEO, perhaps it will be front-end development. Now I can be interested in everything, the main thing is that it be fun, creative, keep my brains in good shape and, of course, bring me money. I consider my strengths to be a sense of humor, responsibility, sociability and a technical mindset.
